### Numbers
- [CheckPrimes.java](Numbers/CheckPrimes.java) - Find the nth Prime

### Dice
- [Dice.java](Dice/Dice.java) - Dice object with method to roll and get value of the roll.
- [DiceMonteCarlo.java](Dice/DiceMonteCarlo.java) - Roll the dice a million times and store the values.
- [RecordThrows.java](Dice/RecordThrows.java) - Throws a dice multiple times and records how many times each value was received.

### Stacks
- [checkPalindrome.java](Stacks/checkPalindrome.java) - Check if a word is palindrome using stacks.
- [reverseWord.java](Stacks/reverseWord.java) - Reverses a word and prints out how the stack changes.

### HackerRank
**This part is the source codes of Maynooth University CS210 Competition. Click [here](https://www.hackerrank.com/test-competition) to MU CS210 Competition on HackerRank.**  
Be adviced, due to the regulation of HackerRank, the code looks _different_ to the normal Java code, which probably could not run in normal Java develop environment. The "Print s n" project is an example of HackerRank behavior. Please note that all challenge in HackerRank which related to **input** must follow the form in the example.  
- [Print s n](HackerRank/Print_s_n/Solution.java) - Print a string _s_ out for _n_ times.  

### Others
**Need to be constructed.**
