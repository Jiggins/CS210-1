***

### Numbers
- [CheckPrimes.java](Numbers/CheckPrimes.java) - Find the nth Prime

### Dice
- [Dice.java](Dice/Dice.java) - Dice object with method to roll and get value of the roll.
- [DiceMonteCarlo.java](Dice/DiceMonteCarlo.java) - Roll the dice a million times and store the values.
- [RecordThrows.java](Dice/RecordThrows.java) - Throws a dice multiple times and records how many times each value was received.

### Stacks
- [checkPalindrome.java](Stacks/checkPalindrome.java) - Check if a word is palindrome using stacks.
- [reverseWord.java](Stacks/reverseWord.java) - Reverses a word and prints out how the stack changes.

### Sorting Algorithms
**This folder is for the sorting algoritms we have to know in java**
- [bubbleSort.java](SortingAlgorithms/bubbleSort.java) - Bubble Sort
- [Part1.java](SortingAlgorithms/Part1.java) - This file includes all sorting algorithms that we have learnt, to be precise, it includes Bubble, Selection and Insertion sorting.

### LinkedList and Patient System
- [lab9.java](Lab09/src/lab9.java) - The main class of patient system.
- [Queue.java](Lab09/src/Queue.java) - The queue class (related to LinkedList).

### Sieve of Eratothenes
**Note that in this package you could learn how to deal with command argument and parse them to the program.**
- [IndexOfPrime.java](SieveOfEratothenes/src/IndexOfPrime.java) - The code could print out the certain prime number with given index. Note that this code was modified to accept command argument. Run `java IndexOfPrime 100` is same as input 100 when the program prompt without any argument.
- [Solution.java](SieveOfEratothenes/src/Solution.java) - This could could print out a list of prime numbers from 2 to a certain number. Note that this code was modified to accept command argument. Run `java Solution 100` is same as input 100 when the program prompt without any argument.

### Fibonacci Sequence
**See the command help information, complie and run `java Fibonacci -help` in Command Prompt or Terminal. This package includes the method of creating a parameter-supported java program and exception handle statement.**
- [Fibonacci.java](FibonacciSequence/src/Fibonacci.java) - The main class.

### Triangular Numbers
**A triangular number counts the objects that can form an equilateral triangle. The _n_-th triangular number is the number of dots composing a triangle with _n_ dots on a side, and is equal to the sum of the _n_ natural numbers from 1 to _n_. Click [_here_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_number) to redirect to the Wikipedia page of Triangular Number.**
- [triNum.java](TriangularNumber/src/triNum.java) - The code provides two different ways: Print out the list of triangular numbers or only one with the index. Run `java triNum -help` for more information.

### Recursion Study
- [sum.java](recursionStudy/src/sum.java) - Use recursion only to figure out the accumulative sum.
- [gcd.java](recursionStudy/src/gcd.java) - Finding the [_greatest common divisor_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of two numbers use recursion only.

### HackerRank
**This part is the source codes of Maynooth University CS210 Competition. Click [_here_](https://www.hackerrank.com/test-competition) to MU CS210 Competition on HackerRank.**  
Be adviced, due to the regulation of HackerRank, the code looks _different_ to the normal Java code, which probably could not run in normal Java develop environment. The "Print s n" project is an example of HackerRank behavior. Please note that all challenge in HackerRank which related to **input** must follow the form in the example. Forthermore, the class name in HackerRank must be "Solution".  
- [Print s n](HackerRank/Print_s_n/Solution.java) - Print a string _s_ out for _n_ times.
